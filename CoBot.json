Before washing produce, wash your hands\nThe importance of washing hands to prevent the spread of Covid-19 cannot be emphasised enough. Even when you are going to rinse vegetables, you must ensure that your hands are clean. Wash them for at least 20 seconds prior to cleaning fruit and vegetable produce. It is a good idea to wash them afterwards too, as suggested by the FDA.\n\n2. Rinse your produce well in running water\n\nAll the fruits and vegetable produce that is purchased from the market can be rinsed in running water, followed by rubbing with hands. This is all that is needed to clean a majority of vegetables. The FDA recommends, \"Rinse produce BEFORE you peel it, so dirt and bacteria aren't transferred from the knife onto the fruit or vegetable.\"\n\n(Also Read:<a href=\"https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/should-you-soak-fruits-in-water-heres-the-answer-1911705\" target=\"_blank\" >Should You Soak Fruits In Water? Here's The Answer</a>)\n\nfctmnm18Rinsing fruits and vegetables in water is sufficient. \n3. Do not use soap or any detergent\n\nThe FDA says it is a complete myth that soap, detergent or any special liquid is required to clean produce. \"Gently rub produce while holding under plain running water. There's no need to use soap or a produce wash.\" If damage or bruising occurs before eating or handling, it is best to cut away the damaged areas before preparing or eating.\n\n4. Use a brush or sponge if necessary\n\nWhile cleaning root vegetables like potatoes or carrots, a vegetable brush or sponge should be used to ensure all dirt is removed. \"Use a clean vegetable brush to scrub firm produce such as melons and cucumbers,\" recommends FDA.\n\n(Also Read: <a href=\"https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/how-to-wash-your-greens-5-expert-tips-to-clean-your-leafy-vegetables-1762585\" target=\"_blank\">How To Wash Your Greens: 5 Expert Tips To Clean Your Leafy Vegetables</a>)\n\n\n5. Certain vegetables and fruits require extra care\n\nBerries require extra attention during the cleaning process. Place them in a colander and rinse them under running water to remove pathogens. Similarly, lettuce and leafy greens should be placed in a bowl of cold water. FDA also suggests removing the outermost leaves of a head of lettuce or cabbage, and then drying them with a paper towel for best results.\n\nThere are certain guidelines that the FDA prescribes apart from these, such as - we must always try and choose produce that isn't bruised or damaged. Further, make sure that pre-cut items, such as bags of lettuce or watermelon slices, are either refrigerated, or kept on ice, both in the store and at home. The FSSAI also tweeted with some recommendations for food safety. \n(Also Read: <a href=\"https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/dont-wash-chicken-before-cooking-it-warns-food-standards-agency-695445\" target=\"_blank\">Don't Wash Chicken Before Cooking it, Warns Food Standards Agency</a>)\n\nMeanwhile, it is a good idea to cook your food thoroughly before consuming. \"Keep the raw and cooked food separate, especially raw meat and fresh produce,\" says the World Health Organisation (WHO) in an article on food and nutrition tips during quarantine. WHO recommends consuming a minimum of 400 g (i.e. 5 portions) of fruits and vegetables per day, and reiterated that we must work towards ensuring that the foods we consume are safe and healthy.\n"

While person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 poses a much greater risk than transmission via surfaces, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces at least once a day, even if you’re not leaving the house. That’s because anytime items or people come in and out of your home, there’s some possibility of exposure.  A recent study found that the novel coronavirus can remain in the air for up to three hours and live on surfaces such as cardboard for up to 24 hours, and plastic and stainless steel for up to three days."

The virus is primarily spread by respiratory droplets transmitted via close contact (within 6 feet) with an infected person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Respiratory droplets are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nThe increase in the general public buying surgical face masks has resulted in mask shortages for some health care workers. So should you wear a face mask to protect yourself from the virus, even if you're not sick?\n\n\"The current recommendations regarding masks are that if you yourself are sick with fever and cough, you can wear a surgical mask to prevent transmission to other people. If you are healthy, there is not thought to be any additional benefit to wearing a mask yourself because the mask is not airtight and does not necessarily prevent breathing in of these viral particles, which are very tiny,\" says Dr. Nipunie Rajapakse, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases specialist.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYFTq_xkKg0&feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\">Watch: When should you wear a face mask?</a>\n\n\nJournalists: A broadcast-quality sound bite (0:27) with Dr. Rajapakse is in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy \"Nipunie Rajapakse, M.D./Infectious Diseases/Mayo Clinic.\"\n\nIf you are going to a clinic or hospital to be seen by a health care provider because of concerns of cough or fever, Dr. Rajapakse recommends wearing a face mask to avoid transmitting possible infection or virus to other patients and medical staff. Face masks also are recommended for health care workers and people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings (at home or in a health care facility). \n\n\"Most people who do not work in a health care setting have not received training on how to put on and take off the masks properly. Doing this incorrectly can actually increase your risk of infection. Also, people who are wearing masks tend to touch their face more than those who are not, which can paradoxically result in an increased risk of infection as well,\" says Dr. Rajapakse.\n\nShe says instead of wearing masks, people need to:\n\nWash their hands frequently using soap and water for 20 seconds or an alcohol-based hand rub.\nAvoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth.\nPractice cough etiquette. Cough into a flexed elbow or tissue, discard the tissue in the trash, and wash hands.\nStay home from school, work and public places if feeling unwell.\nCheck the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CDC website</a>  for additional updates on COVID-19."

If you have small meetups, consider hanging out with another family or friend who is also taking extra measures to put distance between themselves and others (i.e. social distancing). Make sure children practice everyday preventive behaviors , such as cleaning and then disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Remember, if children meet outside of school in bigger groups, it can put everyone at risk. This includes spring break and other group travel. Parents should help their older children revise spring break plans that included non-essential travel to crowded areas. Information about COVID-19 in children is somewhat limited, but current data suggest children with COVID-19 may show only mild symptoms.

While we don’t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we can use the information gained from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods.

            "Stay in touch with your child’s school. Many schools are adapting in-person lessons to online or virtual learning. Review assignments from the school, and help your child establish a reasonable pace for completing the work. You may need to assist your child with turning on devices, reading instructions, and typing answers. Communicate challenges to your school. If you face technology or connectivity issues, or if your child is having a hard time completing assignments, let the school know. Create a schedule and routine for learning at home, but remain flexible. Have consistent bedtimes and get up at the same time, Monday through Friday. Structure the day for learning, free time, healthy meals and snacks, and physical activity. Allow flexibility in the schedule—it’s okay to adapt based on your day. Consider the needs and adjustment required for your child’s age group. The transition to being at home will be different for preschoolers, K-5, middle school students, and high school students. Talk to your child about expectations and how they are adjusting to being at home versus at school. Consider ways your child can stay connected with their friends without spending time in person. Look for ways to make learning fun. Have hands-on activities, like puzzles, painting, drawing, and making things. Independent play can also be used in place of structured learning. Encourage children to build a fort from sheets or practice counting by stacking blocks. Practice handwriting and grammar by writing letters to family members. This is a great way to connect and limit face-to-face contact. Start a journal with your child to document this time and discuss the shared experience. Use audio books or see if your local library is hosting virtual or live-streamed reading events."
